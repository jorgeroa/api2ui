# Milestone v0.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-02
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 13

## Overview

Transform any API into a visual interface through four focused phases: establish the foundation with basic URL-to-UI rendering, add sophisticated handling for nested data and OpenAPI specs, enable user customization with persistence, and complete the experience with multi-endpoint navigation and a polished landing page. Each phase delivers observable value, building from core engine to production-ready tool.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Rendering

**Goal**: User can paste an API URL and see live data rendered as a functional UI with basic components
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: ENG-01, ENG-03, ENG-04, RND-01, RND-02, NAV-03, NAV-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User pastes a REST API URL and sees data rendered automatically
  2. Arrays display as tables with columns for each field
  3. Objects display as detail views with key-value pairs
  4. Loading states appear during data fetch
  5. Specific error messages show for CORS, network, and parse failures
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Project scaffold + types + API fetch service
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Schema inference engine (TDD)
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — UI components + registry + store + app shell wiring

### Phase 2: Advanced Rendering & OpenAPI

**Goal**: User can handle complex APIs with nested data, parameters, and OpenAPI spec support
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: ENG-02, RND-03, RND-04, RND-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can provide OpenAPI/Swagger spec URL and get rendered UI
  2. User can click item in table to see detail view in modal or panel
  3. Nested arrays render as sub-tables within detail views
  4. Deep nesting is handled with configurable max depth (deeper levels collapsed)
  5. API parameters render as form controls with required params prominent and optional params expandable
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Master-detail modal + collapsible nested sections
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — OpenAPI parser service (TDD)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Parameter forms + store integration + app wiring

### Phase 3: Configuration System

**Goal**: User can customize component types, visibility, labels, and styling with configurations persisting across sessions
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: CFG-01, CFG-02, CFG-03, CFG-04, CFG-05, CFG-06, CFG-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Developer can toggle between Configure mode (with settings panel and inline editing) and View mode (clean output)
  2. Developer can override component type for any field (e.g., change table to cards)
  3. Developer can hide/show individual fields
  4. Developer can map field names to custom display labels
  5. Developer can customize CSS styling
  6. Configurations persist in local storage and reload on page refresh
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Config store with persist middleware + theme CSS variables
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Configure toggle button + slide-out panel + theme applier
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Field visibility controls + label editing (inline + panel)
- [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — Component type overrides + preview picker + new renderers
- [x] 03-05-PLAN.md — Drag-and-drop reordering + style customization panel

### Phase 4: Navigation & Polish

**Goal**: User can navigate multi-endpoint APIs seamlessly and new users can discover value through polished landing page with examples
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: NAV-01, NAV-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Multi-endpoint APIs auto-generate sidebar navigation
  2. Landing page displays URL input field and clickable example APIs
  3. User can click example API and immediately see rendered result
  4. Navigation between endpoints preserves configurations
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Sidebar navigation with tag-based grouping for multi-endpoint specs
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Landing page example cards with auto-fetch on click

## Progress

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Foundation & Core Rendering | 3/3 | Complete | 2026-02-01 |
| 2. Advanced Rendering & OpenAPI | 3/3 | Complete | 2026-02-01 |
| 3. Configuration System | 5/5 | Complete | 2026-02-02 |
| 4. Navigation & Polish | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-02-02 |

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Read-only for v1 (Rationale: Reduces complexity, focuses on core rendering engine)
- Public APIs only for v1 (Rationale: Avoids auth complexity)
- Fixed component set for v1 (Rationale: Extensibility adds complexity)
- Master-detail for nesting (Rationale: Natural pattern for hierarchical data)
- Two modes configure/view (Rationale: Separates developer tooling from consumer experience)
- Local storage for configs (Rationale: No backend needed for v1)
- CSS-based scrolling instead of react-window (Rationale: react-window 2.x breaking API)
- Headless UI for accessible Disclosure/Dialog (Rationale: Accessible, composable)
- @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop (Rationale: Lightweight, accessible, React-first)
- Zustand with persist middleware (Rationale: Simple state management with localStorage)

**Issues Resolved:**
- react-window 2.x breaking API → used CSS-based scrolling alternative
- Component badge only appeared when override was set → fixed to always show in Configure mode
- Theme presets had no visual effect → fixed renderers to use CSS variable utilities
- swagger-parser Buffer not defined in browser → polyfilled Buffer globally

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Buffer polyfill for swagger-parser browser compatibility (consider replacing with lighter parser)
- SkeletonDetail.tsx orphaned component (exists but never imported)
- react-window installed but unused (CSS scrolling used instead)
