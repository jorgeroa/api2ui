## Current Test

[testing complete - all gaps closed]

## Tests

### 1. Profile object renders as hero
expected: Object with name + 2+ contact fields (email, phone, address) auto-selects hero layout instead of detail view. You should see a profile-like card with the name prominently displayed.
result: pass
notes: "jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1 renders as Profile (hero). 'Leanne Graham' displays as heading with contact fields below. Fixed by removing root $ skip and adding field-name fallback for contact detection."

### 2. Complex nested object renders as tabs
expected: Object with 3+ nested objects/arrays auto-selects tabs layout instead of detail. Each nested structure appears as a separate tab rather than inline.
result: pass
notes: "dummyjson.com/products/1 renders as Tabs. 5 nested structures (Tags, Dimensions, Reviews, Meta, Images) appear as separate tabs. Fixed by removing root $ skip."

### 3. Short string array renders as chips
expected: A primitive array of short strings (like tags: ["electronics", "sale", "new"]) renders as colored chip/pill elements instead of a plain list.
result: pass
notes: "dummyjson.com/products/1 tags array ['beauty', 'mascara'] renders as Tags (chips) automatically. Smart default correctly triggered for root-level primitive arrays."

### 4. Long string array stays as list
expected: A primitive array with long string values (avg >20 chars) or more than 10 items keeps the default primitive-list rendering, not chips.
result: pass
notes: "dummyjson.com/products/1 images array (URLs) correctly stays as Bullet List. Long URL strings not misidentified as chips."

### 5. Component switcher still works for objects
expected: Even when smart defaults apply (e.g., hero for profile), clicking the component switcher badge still lets you manually switch between detail/hero/tabs/split/json. User override takes precedence.
result: pass
notes: "Manually switching /users/1 from Profile to Detail works correctly. All options (Detail, Profile, Tabs, Split, JSON) available."

### 6. Non-matching objects fall back to detail
expected: Objects without clear profile/complex/split patterns (e.g., a simple {id, value} object) render as the default detail view, same as before Phase 14.1.
result: pass
notes: "Nested Address object within /users/1 correctly shows Detail. Nested Dimensions object within /products/1 correctly shows Detail. Simple objects without matching patterns fall back properly."

## Gaps

None - all gaps closed by commit 1d59548.

### Closed Gaps

- truth: "Objects with profile-like semantics (name + email/phone/address) default to hero instead of detail"
  status: fixed
  fix: "Removed root $ skip in findAnalyzablePaths. Added field-name fallback regex in checkProfilePattern for contact fields whose semantic detection doesn't reach high confidence."
  commit: 1d59548

- truth: "Objects with many nested objects/arrays default to tabs instead of detail"
  status: fixed
  fix: "Removed root $ skip in findAnalyzablePaths. Root objects now analyzed for complex nested pattern (3+ nested object/array fields)."
  commit: 1d59548
